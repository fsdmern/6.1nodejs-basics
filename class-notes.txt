Modules in NodeJS
===============
Modules are libraries. They are set of functions that user may include while building the server

Built-in Modules:
==================
Nodejs has a set of Built-in modules that doesnt require any seperate installation

How to Include Modules:
==========================
need to use require() function
var http = require('http')

We can create our own modules using NodeJS
===========================================
exports.myDateTime = function() {
    return Date()
}

exports keyword make the properties and methods available outside the module file

NodeJS File System: (fs module)
=================================
var fs = require('fs')

Uses of fs module:
==================
It can perform various operations on files at operation system level:
Read, Create, Update, Delete, Rename files
Ex:
====
fs.readFile() method is used to read files located on your computer
fs.appendFile() -- this can be for writing new file
fs.open() -- takes a flag w for writing which opens file for writing. file will be created if not present
fs.writeFile() -- it overwrites the contents if file already exists else it creates new file



NodeJS Events:
===============
Every action on a computer is an event. Ex: Connect to wi-fi, open a folder or file, open a browser

Objects in NodeJS can fire events, like the readStream object which fires events when opening or closing the files

var fs = require('fs')
var rs = fs.createReadStream(./demofile.txt)
rs.on('open' function() {
 console.log("This file is open")
})

Events Module:
===================
var events = require("events")
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter()

var myEventHandler = function () {
    console.log("I can hear system sound")
}

eventEmitter.on('syssound',myEventHandler)

eventEmitter.emit('syssound')
